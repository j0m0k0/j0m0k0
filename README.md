## About Me
I am pursuing a Doctoral degree in Computer Science at Texas State University. My research interests include Software
Supply Chain Reliability, Cyber-Physical Systems, Game Theory and Deep Learning. After hours, youâ€™ll find me at the
gym, watching movies, playing video games, and making food and drink.
